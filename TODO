#TODO

1. Create class for convolutional neural net
2. feed it images using the DataLoad class
3. Put the CNN's input into a recurrent neural net

I will use a CNN because they are great at analyzing pixels in images
and I will use a RNN due to reading that they are good for pattern recognition and recurrent connections

#DONE

1. Downloaded dataset
2. Created script to resize all images in the dataset to a uniform length
